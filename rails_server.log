AbstractController::ActionNotFound - The delete_confirm action could not be found for the :find_scenario
callback on User::ScenariosController, but it is listed in the controller's
:only option.
Raising for missing callback actions is a new default in Rails 7.1, if you'd
like to turn this off you can delete the option from the environment configurations
or set `config.action_controller.raise_on_missing_callback_actions` to `false`.:

AbstractController::ActionNotFound - The show action could not be found for the :find_account
callback on Admin::AccountsController, but it is listed in the controller's
:only option.
Raising for missing callback actions is a new default in Rails 7.1, if you'd
like to turn this off you can delete the option from the environment configurations
or set `config.action_controller.raise_on_missing_callback_actions` to `false`.:
