# Vue 3 Migration Plan for HatamotoHQ

## Overview
This document outlines the migration strategy from Vue 2.6.12 to Vue 3, focusing on a phased approach to minimize disruption to the platform.

## Current State Analysis

### Vue 2 Dependencies
- Vue 2.6.12 with Options API
- Vuex 3.5.1 for state management
- Bootstrap-Vue 2.17.3 for UI components
- Multiple Vue 2-specific plugins
- 100+ Vue components using Options API

### Critical Migration Challenges
1. **Bootstrap-Vue**: No official Vue 3 version - requires replacement
2. **Global Filters**: Used extensively for date/time formatting
3. **Event Bus Pattern**: Heavy usage of $emit across components
4. **Vue 2 Plugins**: Many dependencies are Vue 2 only

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Preparation (2-3 weeks)
1. **Audit and Document**
   - Create inventory of all Vue 2 specific features
   - Document component dependencies
   - Identify business-critical components

2. **Setup Migration Environment**
   - Create a feature branch for Vue 3 migration
   - Setup Vue 3 compatibility build
   - Install @vue/compat for gradual migration

3. **Replace Critical Dependencies**
   - Research Bootstrap-Vue alternatives:
     - Option A: Bootstrap 5 with custom Vue 3 components
     - Option B: PrimeVue or Vuetify 3
     - Option C: Gradual component-by-component replacement
   - Find Vue 3 compatible alternatives for plugins

### Phase 2: Core Migration (4-6 weeks)
1. **Update Build System**
   ```json
   // package.json updates
   {
     "vue": "^3.4.0",
     "@vue/compat": "^3.4.0",
     "vuex": "^4.1.0",
     "@vitejs/plugin-vue": "^5.0.0"
   }
   ```

2. **Global API Changes**
   - Convert filters to global properties or composables
   - Update plugin registrations
   - Replace event bus with mitt or native solutions

3. **Component Migration (Priority Order)**
   - Start with leaf components (no children)
   - Message components (critical for LINE bot functionality)
   - Channel/Chat components
   - Admin/Agency/User layouts
   - Complex components (FlexMessage Editor, etc.)

### Phase 3: Composition API Migration (Optional, 4-6 weeks)
1. **Gradual Conversion**
   - Convert simple components first
   - Use `<script setup>` for new components
   - Keep Options API for complex components initially

2. **Create Composables**
   - `useLineBot()` for LINE API interactions
   - `useWebSocket()` for real-time features
   - `useAuth()` for authentication logic

### Phase 4: Testing and Optimization (2-3 weeks)
1. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - Unit tests for migrated components
   - Integration tests for critical flows
   - Performance benchmarking

2. **Optimization**
   - Tree-shaking improvements
   - Bundle size optimization
   - Runtime performance tuning

## Implementation Roadmap

### Week 1-2: Setup and Planning
- [ ] Create migration branch
- [ ] Install Vue 3 and @vue/compat
- [ ] Setup compatibility mode
- [ ] Document all breaking changes

### Week 3-4: Dependency Updates
- [ ] Replace vue-template-compiler with @vue/compiler-sfc
- [ ] Update esbuild configuration for Vue 3
- [ ] Research and test Bootstrap-Vue replacement

### Week 5-8: Core Component Migration
- [ ] Migrate utility components
- [ ] Update Vuex to v4
- [ ] Migrate message-related components
- [ ] Update routing if needed

### Week 9-12: Feature Components
- [ ] Migrate channel/chat components
- [ ] Update broadcast components
- [ ] Migrate admin/agency components
- [ ] Convert global filters

### Week 13-14: Testing Phase
- [ ] Run full test suite
- [ ] Performance testing
- [ ] User acceptance testing
- [ ] Bug fixes and refinements

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas
1. **Real-time Chat**: WebSocket integration needs careful testing
2. **Message Builder**: Complex component with many dependencies
3. **Third-party Integrations**: LINE API, Google Sheets, PMS

### Mitigation Strategies
- Maintain Vue 2 branch for hotfixes during migration
- Use feature flags for gradual rollout
- Extensive testing in staging environment
- Prepare rollback plan

## Alternative Approach: Incremental Migration

If full migration is too risky, consider:
1. **Micro-Frontend Architecture**
   - New features in Vue 3
   - Existing features remain in Vue 2
   - Gradual component-by-component migration

2. **Module Federation**
   - Use webpack module federation
   - Run Vue 2 and Vue 3 side by side
   - Migrate one module at a time

## Success Criteria

- All tests passing
- No regression in functionality
- Performance improvement or parity
- Bundle size reduction (target: 20% smaller)
- Improved developer experience

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve migration plan
2. Allocate resources (2-3 developers recommended)
3. Setup CI/CD for migration branch
4. Begin Phase 1 preparation

## Conclusion

Vue 3 migration will bring significant benefits:
- Better performance
- Improved TypeScript support
- Modern development experience
- Future-proof architecture

However, given the extensive use of Vue 2 specific features and dependencies, this migration requires careful planning and execution. The phased approach minimizes risk while ensuring a smooth transition.
